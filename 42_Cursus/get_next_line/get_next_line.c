>> ssize_t	r;
1- "r" will be the return from the function read(), whenever we call it with
the fd the function recieves.

>> char	*temp;
1- This will be the array of all the characters each time we read the file. 
BUT, we'll read <BUFFER_SIZE> amount of characters, no more, no less.
2- Since this is a temp string for the <BUFFER_SIZE> amount of characters, we
can already do malloc to ith with the amount we know we need. Plus one because
of the null character ('\0').

>> r = 1;
1- Here we would use a do-while but since it's prohibited by norm, we have to
do a weird method where inside the while, one condition is "r != 0", which
basically means, read() was able to read something (If positive).

>> while (!ft_look_for_char(static_string, '\n') && r != 0)
1- The "r" condition is really easy, "r" is the return value of the function
read() everytime we call it, and it it's positive we'll keep going. But if
it's negative we have a sepparate condition inside the while loop.

2- The "!ft_look_for_char(static_string, '\n')" conditon may look a little bit
strange, but basically what we're trying to ask with "ft_look_for_char()" 
(without negation) is: Is there a new line character in the "temp" char array?
If there is, then we can finally get a LINE, and we can leave the loop. If
not, then we shall keep going.

Â· So then, this while loop will only stop if: read() function does NOT return
a positive value, OR if the ft_look_for_char() returns something different from 
NULL, which basically means "We didn't find a new line character in this string".

>> if (r == -1)
1- If the read fails inside the loop, we just free "temp", because it's dynamic
memory and we don't wanna waste space. And we also free "static_string", in
case there's something saved in there, because again, this is all dynamic
memory, in which we don't wanna waste space on. 

>> temp[r] = '\0';
1- Here we are just manually writing assigning the null character to the string.
This is why I had to do the "(BUFFER_SIZE + 1)" when we did the malloc to "temp".

>> free(temp);
>> return (static_string);
1- Then we can just free "temp" because we don't use it anymore, and return the
new assigned "static_string".

>> static_string = ft_read_file(fd);
1- We gotta read the FILE DESCRIPTOR that we recieved UNTIL we find a new line
character ('\n'), and then we save it into the static variable "static_string".


>> returned_line = ft_look_for_line(static_string);
2- Here we'll actually be trying to get_the_next_LINE. "returned_line" is going
to be the next line from where the "static_string" static variable is positioned.
Because, the BUFFER_SIZE won't always be the exact same size as the file we are
reading, or the line we are keeping. For example, if our file reads:

"
Hello World
Abc
Goodbye World
"

And our BUFFER_SIZE is 20, if we were to print that we would get something like
this the first time we execute the program:

"
Hello World
Abc
Good
"

But the first line's length is only 12 characters counting the new line
character ('\n').
So our line is 12 characters long, and the "static_string" variable has 20
characters because of the BUFFER_SIZE. This is where the  ft_look_for_line()
function will do its job.


>> static_string = ft_remaining_string(static_string);
3- Here we are going to be re-assigning the "static_string" to anything that's
left in the "static_variable" AFTER the new line character ('\n').
In the previous example, the remaining characters after the new line character,
and after the BUFFER_SIZE end are:
"
Abc
Good
"
And now, we will make sure to keep this in the "static_string" variable, so that
when we call the  ft_read_file() function, we can continue to read from the
remaining characters.


>> return (returned_line);
4- And finally, we just return the extracted line.
