/****************************************************************************

Â· Here we would need a do-while but since it's prohibited by norm, we have to
do a weird method where inside the while one condition is "r != 0", which
basically means, read() was able to read something (If positive).

>> ssize_t	r;
1- "r" will be the return from the function read(), whenever we call it with
the fd the function recieves.

>> char	*temp;
1- This will be the array of all the characters each time we read the file. 
BUT, we'll read <BUFFER_SIZE> amount of characters, no more, no less.


****************************************************************************/
int	ft_read_file(int fd)
{
	ssize_t	r;
	char	*temp;

	r = 1;

	return (0);
}

/****************************************************************************

>> static_string = ft_read_file(fd);
1- We gotta read the FILE DESCRIPTOR that we recieved UNTIL we find a new line
character ('\n'), and then we save it into the static variable "static_string".


>> returned_line = ft_look_for_line(static_string);
2- Here we'll actually be trying to get_the_next_LINE. "returned_line" is going
to be the next line from where the "static_string" static variable is positioned.
Because, the BUFFER_SIZE won't always be the exact same size as the file we are
reading, or the line we are keeping. For example, if our file reads:

"
Hello World
Abc
Goodbye World
"

And our BUFFER_SIZE is 20, if we were to print that we would get something like
this the first time we execute the program:

"
Hello World
Abc
Good
"

But the first line's length is only 12 characters counting the new line
character ('\n').
So our line is 12 characters long, and the "static_string" variable has 20
characters because of the BUFFER_SIZE. This is where the  ft_look_for_line()
function will do its job.


>> static_string = ft_remaining_string(static_string);
3- Here we are going to be re-assigning the "static_string" to anything that's
left in the "static_variable" AFTER the new line character ('\n').
In the previous example, the remaining characters after the new line character,
and after the BUFFER_SIZE end are:
"
Abc
Good
"
And now, we will make sure to keep this in the "static_string" variable, so that
when we call the  ft_read_file() function, we can continue to read from the
remaining characters.


>> return (returned_line);
4- And finally, we just return the extracted line.
